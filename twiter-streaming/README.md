* **twitter**: described in the Tutorial https://programmerfriend.com/spring-boot-websocket/
  <br> A twitter stream built with Twitter4J. It sends the received tweets via a WebSocket Connection to the frontends.
  <br> There are two frontends: Vanilla JS (inside the Spring Boot application's index.html) and a React Frontend (living in the twitter-frontend subfolder).<br>
